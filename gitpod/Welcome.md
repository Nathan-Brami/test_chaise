# Welcome to Lichess on Gitpod

> Your development environment is now building.

You can watch the progress in the terminal tabs that are running:

1. `ui`: Watches the static assets for changes and automatically rebuilds the scripts and stylesheets
2. `lila`: Starts the main Lichess server
3. `lila-ws`: Starts the websocket server
4. `setup`: Sets up your configs, seeds your test database, and starts background services

It will take about 8-10 minutes.

For the URL of your development site, click the PORTS tab, then follow the link for port 8080.

For test logins and more documentation, see https://lichess-org.github.io/lila-gitpod/
